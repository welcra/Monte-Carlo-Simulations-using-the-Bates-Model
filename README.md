# Monte-Carlo-Simulations-using-the-Bates-Model

First, using current options data for a stock, a Bates model is calibrated. Then, using those parameters, price paths are generated, offering much more accuracy with stochastic volatility and jump diffusion compared to a simple GBM. The monte carlo simulation of price paths leads to generation of risk management metrics.
